Burger Queen: The Great Fast-Food Hoax

On November 11, 2048, Burger Queen was ostensibly founded with its headquarters at Av. de la Gare 22, 1003 Lausanne, Switzerland. The company quickly gained attention for its supposed gourmet burgers and commitment to sustainability.

However, an investigation by the independent newspaper Lausanne Ledger has uncovered that Burger Queen is actually a fake company, created as a social experiment by the student group "11bis" from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

The students orchestrated the hoax to study consumer behavior and media influence, crafting an elaborate backstory, a fictitious headquarters, and a sophisticated online presence. They went as far as developing a detailed menu, complete with descriptions of gourmet burgers and eco-friendly practices.

Lausanne Ledger reporters discovered discrepancies when attempting to visit the listed headquarters, which turned out to be an unrelated office building. Further investigation revealed that all promotional materials and online reviews were generated by the 11bis group.

The revelation of the Burger Queen hoax has sparked widespread discussion about the power of social experiments, the ease of manipulating public perception, and the critical role of investigative journalism in uncovering the truth. The 11bis students have since disclosed their methods and findings, contributing valuable insights into modern consumer culture and media dynamics.
